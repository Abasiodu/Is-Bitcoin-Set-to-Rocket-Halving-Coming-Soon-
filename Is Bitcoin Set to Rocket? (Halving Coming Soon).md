# Bitcoin’s Next Halving: Will It Reach $200K? 📈

00:00:00 - 00:00:14  
Okay, so this guy, the former CTO of Coinbase, made an insane bet that Bitcoin will hit one million dollars within the next three months. Now, that’s definitely not coming true, but I do think that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 within the next few years. 🚀

00:00:12 - 00:00:27  
The reason why boils down to Bitcoin's upcoming halving event. So, every four years, Bitcoin has this thing called a halving, and previous ones have brought meteoric gains in terms of price. 📊

00:00:25 - 00:00:39  
But you know what they say, past performance is no guarantee of future results. So, that’s why I’m wondering: will this next halving also make Bitcoin rocket, or is this time different? 🤔

00:00:36 - 00:00:49  
That’s the question we’re going to answer today, and to answer it, we’ve got to start with understanding the halving theory itself. 🔍

00:00:46 - 00:01:01  
Like, why do some people say that Bitcoin going up is baked into its code? Well, that’s because Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that every four years, the reward for mining a block gets cut in half. 💡

00:00:59 - 00:01:12  
This makes Bitcoin have a more gradual release of its coins until its maximum of 21 million is reached. So far, there’ve been three halvings in Bitcoin’s history, and the fourth one is coming up real soon—in April 2024. 📅

00:01:10 - 00:01:23  
Historically, these halving events have been big drivers of Bitcoin’s price, with big rallies both before and after the halving. 📈

00:01:21 - 00:01:34  
That’s why this is such an important topic to discuss and analyze. If the halving theory comes true again, then we better have the right strategy to take advantage of it. 🧠

00:01:32 - 00:01:44  
Okay, but why would the halving make Bitcoin rocket? Well, the theory says it’s because of supply and demand. As Bitcoin’s emission rate gets cut in half, there’s less Bitcoin getting sold by the miners who need to fund their operations. 💰

00:01:42 - 00:01:56  
If demand stays roughly the same, then the price must go up. It’s simple economics. But can we assume that demand will stay the same? That is a massive assumption. 📉

00:01:54 - 00:02:06  
There are no guarantees, of course, but if we look at some recent trends, it’s not hard to imagine a world where demand for Bitcoin goes up, let alone stays the same. 🌍

00:02:04 - 00:02:16  
With all the banking crises going on, a lot of people are turning to Bitcoin to keep some of their money outside the traditional finance world. Also, if the FED pivots and turns the money printer back on, Bitcoin would surely rocket. 📉📈

00:02:14 - 00:02:27  
Also, just look at this chart: the supply of Bitcoin that hasn’t moved for over a year is at all-time highs. So, there’s more people holding and periodically buying than ever before. 📈

00:02:25 - 00:02:38  
That’s super critical to this theory because the halving reduces the supply that miners can sell, but you also have selling pressure from paper-handed speculators who bought near the top and are waiting for the right price to dump their Bitcoin. 📉

00:02:36 - 00:02:47  
It’s their selling pressure that suppresses the price of Bitcoin throughout the bear market. But what makes Bitcoin special is its loyal following of holders who buy periodically and never sell. 🙌

00:02:45 - 00:02:58  
When their consistent buying eventually absorbs all the speculators’ selling, then the price starts to break out into a new bull market. That’s when the FOMO comes back, newbies fight back in, and the whole cycle plays out all over again. 🔄

00:02:56 - 00:03:10  
So that’s the halving theory for you. But don’t get too bullish yet, because there are also some good arguments against it. 🤨

00:03:18 - 00:03:30  
Before we get there, I want to show you this. This is a hardware wallet, believe it or not, and it’s made by Tanjim, who’s also the sponsor of this video. It’s a great way to store some of your Bitcoin if you want to diversify where you keep it. 💳

00:03:28 - 00:03:41  
This isn’t like your typical hardware wallet because you don’t need fancy devices, cables, or a computer. It’s literally just a card with a microchip plus an app on your phone. 📲

00:03:39 - 00:03:53  
Tanjim has completely reimagined the hardware wallet, and I’m all for it. No more seed phrases; the private key is on your card, and if you lose that, you have backups too. 🔑

00:03:51 - 00:04:03  
It’s also protected by an access code to prevent unauthorized access, and the chip itself is super secure. They support pretty much every coin out there, so if you want to learn more, just watch my full review video linked below. 🎥

00:04:11 - 00:04:23  
Okay, back to the case against the halving theory. So the first thing that critics like to point out is that there’ve only been three halving events in Bitcoin’s history, and three data points is nowhere near enough to draw conclusions from. 📉

00:04:21 - 00:04:32  
Ideally, we’d have dozens or even hundreds of data points to make a stronger statistical case. But also, even if we did have more data points, past performance still does not guarantee future results. 📊

00:04:30 - 00:04:43  
We definitely cannot assume that something will happen again just because it happened in the past. 📉

00:04:40 - 00:04:53  
Another argument against this theory is that it’s already priced in because everyone can see the halving coming from a mile away. It’s no secret that it’s going to happen in April 2024. 🗓️

00:04:51 - 00:05:03  
So, even if we assume that it’ll bring an increase in price, the market will rationally front-run that increase, and hence, there will be no increase because of the front-running. 📉

00:05:01 - 00:05:13  
Then there’s also the argument that the halving will actually drive down the price of Bitcoin. After the halving, miners will immediately start to earn half their usual Bitcoin per block, so they’ll make less revenue and will have to sell more Bitcoin to cover their operational costs. 💸

00:05:11 - 00:05:24  
Anyways, that’s a lot of food for thought on both sides of the debate. But let’s just assume for a second that this next halving still plays out for the theory. What should we expect in terms of price and timing? 📈

00:05:21 - 00:05:35  
If we grab data from the past three cycles, we get this table. It pretty much shows you the gains for each cycle compared to its previous cycle's low and high. 📉

00:05:32 - 00:05:51  
If we assume that this upcoming halving brings us similar gains as the most recent halving, then that gets us $341,000 if we 22x the previous cycle low, and $241,500 if we 3.5x the previous cycle high. 📈

00:05:49 - 00:06:03  
Now, those numbers probably sound way too ambitious to you, and they do to me too. But also, every halving that we’ve seen, the price multiples have decreased compared to previous ones. 📉

00:06:01 - 00:06:18  
If we take that into account and let’s say we just cut the gains in half, like 11x to the low or 2x the high, then we’d get numbers like $170,000 to $138,000. That honestly sounds much more reasonable to me. 📊

00:06:16 - 00:06:30  
It also makes logical sense because each subsequent halving has less impact on the overall supply. The first halving cut mining rewards from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, but this next one will bring it down from around 6 to around 3. 📉

00:06:28 - 00:06:43  
So it’s a much smaller drop than before
